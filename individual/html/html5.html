                        <h2>Macau</h2>
                        <p>Macau was a pretty fun place to stay because of its food and attractions. There are a few touristic places that are a must-go. One of the hot spots is
                                the Historic Centre. There are about 30 buildings and monuments that are of Portuguese and Chinese origin that are worth visiting. Another place that you 
                                should go is downtown Macau, that's where all the good food is. Macau night life is also pretty fun. There are plenty of bars, night clubs, casinos, KTV 
                                (karaoke places) and restaurants that open till very late.</p>

                        <h2>Hong Kong</h2>
                        <p>If you are visiting Macau, you should definitely visit Hong Kong. It is just a couple hours away riding the ferry. The Peak of Hong Kong is one of the most 
                            visited places by tourists. You will have an astounding view of skyscrappers, the harbour and the green hills of the New Territories area. The Ladies' Market is
                            another place worth visiting too. It is a kilometre of street-market bustle and clothing, accessories and souvenir bargains. If you like amusement parks, you 
                            can go to Hong Kong Disneyland or Ocean Park. These amusement parks are unique to Hong Kong, and offer many thrill rides, amazing shows and lots of fun. Hong 
                            Kong is also a city for window shopping, many tourists from nearby countries travel to Hong Kong just to shop because of its competitive prices.</p>

                        <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
                        <p>There are plenty of things to do in Los Angeles, California. There are a total of 16 museums in LA so you can choose acording to your interests. Some of the 
                            museums I like are Los Angeles County Museum of Art, The Broad, and California Science Center. If you go during any season other than winter, beaches are the
                                place to go. Los Angeles has some really beautiful beaches that you should explore. My favourite ones are: Venice, Malibu, Santa Monica, and Redondo. Redondo 
                                beach has live seafood for sale on the shore that you can buy, and they will steam them for you on the spot. It's pretty yummy! Hollywood Walk of Fame is 
                                another touristic place that you shouldn't miss. There are many things to explore on Hollywood Boulevard if you like celebrities.
